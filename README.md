## Hi! I'm Sean 🌊

3rd-Year CS student interested in all things HPC, Systems, C++, and Low Latency

#### Currently studying:
- C++17 and beyond
- Operating Systems
- Computer Architecture
- Networking

**99 percent** of my work isn't on GitHub, but the 1 percent that is, is in this [physics engine](https://github.com/sean-o-reilly/2d-physics-engine) repo I've been building up lately.
